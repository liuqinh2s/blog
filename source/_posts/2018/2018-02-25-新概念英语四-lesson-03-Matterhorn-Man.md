语言点：
alpinist 实际上是由 Alps 阿尔卑斯山演变来的。

What was the main objective of early mountain climbers?

语言用词的多样性：这里的目标用的是 objective，也可以用 aim，goal 等。

这个问题的答案是：to get to the top by the easiest route

Modern alpinists try to climb mountains by a route which will give them good sport, and the more difficult it is, the more highly it is regarded.

英语用词有时候非常简单，比如这里的 good sport 和 highly。

而翻译成汉语则是：

现代登山运动员总想找一条能够给他们带来运动乐趣的路线来攀登山峰。他们认为，道路愈艰险愈带劲儿。

汉语用的是 运动乐趣 和 带劲儿。也是相当地道的。

In the pioneering days however, this was not the case at all.

然而，在登山运动的初期，全然不是这种情况。

这里的 pioneering days 用法很新鲜，如果是我的话只会想到 early，this was not the case at all 又一次反映了英语用词的简洁。the case 用的很爽。

The early climbers were looking for the easiest way to the top because the summit was the prize they sought, especially if it had never been attained before.

早期登山者所寻找的是通往山顶的最方便的途径，这是他们追寻的目标，特别是前人未曾到达过的山顶。

这里的 early 呼应了前面的 pioneering，the summit was the prize they sought，时刻注意时态，英语就是如此，有不少的细节，需要严谨对待。另外 summit 用来表示山顶，如果是我的话只能想到 top，以后可以用 summit 来代替了。especially if it had never been attained before，我突然想到是不是也可以用 achieved。

It is true that during their explorations they often faced difficulties and dangers of the most perilous nature, equipped in a manner which would make a modern climber shudder at the thought, but they did not go out of their way to court such excitement.

确实，在探险中他们经常遇到惊心动魄的困难和危险，而他们的装备之简陋足以使现代登山者一想起来就胆战心惊。但是他们并非故意寻求这种刺激。

perilous险恶的，perilous nature 用来形容恶劣的自然环境。equipped in a manner which would make a modern climber shudder at the thought，这一句十分经典。court such excitement，这里的 court 表示招致，我以前只知道：法院、球场。

They had a single aim, a solitary goal – the top!

这个用了相同的词来描述同一个事，作为强调。而且语气上是递进的 single 和 solitary 比，solitary 语气更重，aim 和 goal 比，aim 表示一般的泛泛的目标，goal 则常用在体育竞赛方面。

It is hard for us to realize nowadays how difficult it was for the pioneers.

我们今天很难想象昔日的登山先驱是多么艰苦。

Except for one or two places such as Zermatt and Chamonix, which had rapidly become popular.

Alpine villages tended to be impoverished settlements cut off from civilization by the high mountains.

阿尔卑斯山山区的小村几乎全是高山环抱、与世隔绝的穷乡僻壤。

tended to be，几乎全是，用得好。cut off from civilization by the high mountains，简单词用的好，形象的描述了高山环抱、与世隔绝、穷乡僻壤。

Such inns as there were were generally dirty and flea-ridden;the food simply local cheese accompanied by bread often twelve months old, all washed down with coarse wine.

那里的小客栈一般都很脏，而且跳蚤猖獗。食物是当地的干酪和通常存放了一年之久的面包，人们就着劣酒吞下这种食物。

accompanied by 这里用的不错，bread often twelve months old，形容面包和形容人是一样的用法。washed down 用液体灌下。coarse 粗糙的，coarse wine 劣质的酒。

Often a valley boasted no inn at all, and climbers found shelter wherever they could sometimes with the local priest(who was usually as poor as his parishioners), sometimes with shepherds or cheese-makers. Invariably the background was the same: dirt and poverty, and very uncomfortable.

山谷里常常没有小客栈，登山者只好随遇而安。有时同当地牧师（他通常和他的教民一样穷）住在一起，有时同牧羊人或制乳酪的人住在一起。无论在哪儿，情况都一样：肮脏、贫穷，极其不舒适。

boast: to be lucky enough to own。这里不用 have 而是用 boast，表明作者不是在做客观的描述，而是带有感情色彩的。例子：The university boasts the highest number of first-rate teachers in China.

invariably 不变的。

For men accustomed to eating seven-course dinners and sleeping between fine linen sheets at home, the change to the Alps must have been very hard indeed.

对于过惯了一顿饭吃7道菜、睡亚麻细布床单的人来说，变换一下生活环境来到阿尔卑斯山山区，那一定是很艰难的。

seven-course dinners，七道菜的晚饭。sheet 薄片，纸张，床单。
